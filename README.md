# Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, businesses need to be agile and responsive to changing market demands.
One way to achieve this is by leveraging disposable app environments, which provide isolated and ephemeral environments for running applications.
These environments offer several benefits, including improved security, faster development cycles, and reduced costs.

We'll walk you through the process of creating a disposable environment using GKE, leveraging the new Gateway API to drive traffic to the ephemeral apps, and Config Connector to build the infrastructure. We will cover the following topics:

- Introduction to disposable app environments and their benefits
- Leveraging the Kubernetes and Getwau API to drive traffic to the ephemeral apps
- Provisioning and tearing down infrastructure for the ephemeral apps with Kubernetes
- Integrating with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
- Best practices for security and scalability

By the end of this workshop, you will have the knowledge and skills to build and manage your own platform for disposable app environments. Whether you are a developer, system administrator, or DevOps engineer, this workshop will provide valuable insights and practical experience.
