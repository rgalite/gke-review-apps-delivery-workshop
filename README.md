# Introduction

This repository is a playground to play with different technologies on GCP.

## Labs

- [Lab 1 - Review Apps](../../tree/labs/review-apps)

  Review apps are short-lived application environments that enable developers, designers, QA personnel, product managers, and other reviewers to assess and interact with code modifications as part of the code review process. These environments are built using the branch's code, providing a tangible and interactive platform for reviewing proposed changes.

  Through this workshop, we will guide you through the journey of establishing a platform that leverages GKE for the creation of disposable environments. We will incorporate ingresses using the Kubernetes Gateway API to direct traffic towards the short-lived applications. Lastly, we will utilize Config Connector to effortlessly construct the infrastructure dynamically.

- [Lab 2 - Cloud Run](../../tree/labs/cloud-run)

  In this workshop, we'll demystify Cloud Run, a powerful service that lets you run stateless containers that are automatically scaled up or down based on demand. You'll gain practical experience through hands-on labs and exercises. It covers the following topics:
  
  - Deploying applications from source code or container images
  - Configuring custom domains and SSL certificates
  - Integrating with other Google Cloud services Get ready to unlock the potential of serverless with Cloud Run!

- [Lab 3 - Cloud Run Service Mesh](../../tree/labs/cloudrun-service-mesh)
